Chapter justifying the use of R and RStudio


## Why R and Not Another Statistical Program?


### Statistical Programs versus Statistical Programming Language

* Statistical Programs
    + fixed menus
    + limited procedures (at least in the menus)
    + leads to compartmentalizing models (e.g. ANOVA, regression, GLM)
    
* Statistical Programming Languages (SPLs)
    + Turing complete: if you can create an algorithm you can program it
    + Very flexible
    + Integration of models: One model to rule them all!


R is a statistical programming language, which means it is a programming language designed specifically to do statistics.
